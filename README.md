# Task-Manager
A web-based task management application.
Here are some high-level features that the application could have:

User authentication and authorization: Users can sign up, sign in, and sign out. They can also be assigned 
different roles and permissions based on their access level.

Task creation and management: Users can create, assign, and manage tasks. Each task can have a due date, 
priority level, description, and status.

Task assignment and delegation: Users can assign tasks to other users and delegate tasks to other team 
members.

Task tracking and reporting: Users can track the progress of tasks and generate reports based on completed 
tasks, pending tasks, and overdue tasks.

Email notifications: Users can receive email notifications when a task is assigned to them, when a task is 
overdue, or when a task's status is updated.
